Project Description

This project focuses on building a data analytics and machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict customer deposit subscription behavior in a bank marketing context. By leveraging historical customer and campaign data, the project aims to understand the key factors influencing customer decisions and provide a structured, reproducible approach to deposit conversion analysis.

Approach

The workflow covers data cleaning and validation to ensure data accuracy, followed by feature engineering to transform raw variables into business-interpretable segments such as customer groups and campaign intensity levels. Exploratory data analysis is used to identify behavioral patterns, and a logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using standard classification metrics to balance predictive performance with interpretability.

Business Value

The results support more targeted marketing strategies by helping banks identify high-probability customers and avoid inefficient blanket campaigns. This approach enables better allocation of marketing resources, improved conversion efficiency, and more consistent, data-driven decision-making across marketing and analytics teams.
